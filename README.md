# ðŸ«€ Heart Sound MFCC Pipeline (with Visualisations)

This repository contains a complete and visually-explained **MFCC feature extraction pipeline** for analyzing heart-sound audio signals.

---

## ðŸ“Œ What This Project Does

- Loads real `.wav` recordings of heart sounds  
- Applies **preprocessing filters**:
  - High-pass filter (20 Hz) to remove low-frequency drift
  - Low-pass filter (400 Hz) to remove high-frequency noise
  - Savitzky-Golay smoothing for denoising
- Extracts features using the **MFCC pipeline**:
  - Framing + Windowing
  - FFT + Power Spectrum
  - Mel Filter Bank Projection
  - Log Compression
  - DCT to obtain MFCCs
  - Î” and Î”Î” (delta and acceleration) features ( to be added later)
- **Visualises each stage** using Matplotlib

## ðŸŽ¯ Use Case

This pipeline is suitable for:

- **Medical diagnostics research** (e.g., classifying heart murmurs)
- Teaching **digital signal processing** with a hands-on notebook
- Demonstrating **linear algebra in action** with real audio data
- Preprocessing for **CNNs or other deep learning models** working on heart sounds
